# BitTiger-MiniFlickr
太阁X项目四期八组Mini Flickr

In this project, we use the Flickr API[1] to create an infinite scrolling list of photos, which is able to fetch photos from the Flickr Server by keyword searching using HTTP/JSON[2]. This app also support search suggestions. Tapping the image will open a single photo screen for downloading and opening the Flickr official app website.

This android application has the following functionality:

Infinite scrolling with high performance
Pull refreshing
HTTP requesting/responding and JSON parsing
Asynchronous image loading
Menu with SearchView and SearchSuggestion
Activity and fragment
RecyclerView and adapter
